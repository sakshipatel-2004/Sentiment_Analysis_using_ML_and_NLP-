<h2>1.Preprocessing</h2>
-Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.<br>
-Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.<br>
-Removing special characters: Eliminating non-alphanumeric characters, punctuation, and symbols.<br>
-Stopword removal: Removing common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not carry significant meaning.<br>
-Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or root form to reduce inflectional forms.<br>

<h2>2.Model Architecture</h2>
-The model used for sentiment analysis is Logistic Regression.<br>
-The model architecture consists of a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer followed by a logistic regression classifier.<br>

<h2>3.Evaluation Results and Analysis:</h2> 
-The model achieved satisfactory performance.<br>
-Precision, recall, and F1-score indicate balanced performance across classes.<br>
-Further analysis could be conducted on misclassified instances to identify potential areas for improvement.<br>
